# one-time-password
  one time password with firebase(google cloud functions) and twilio
  
  *In this project I have created apis using firebase in which we can authenticate user with the phone number and validate it with OTP sent to his/her phone.
  
  Technologies used: 
   - Firebase tools, Auth, Database and Functions
   - Twilio as a SMS service provider
  
  
  ## we can easily apply this system to any of our applications as this will create google cloud function based URLs for
  *CreateUser using phone number, 
  *Request OTP using phone number and also 
  *Validate user by OTP password
  
  All the urls are tested with the help of POSTMAN application.
